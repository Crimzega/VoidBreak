# VoidBreak

> [!NOTE]
> The current project currently in an incomplete rewritten state from an old variation dubbed as an `Array Hell`, referring to all custom mod blocks, items, biomes and such being a part of and referenced from arrays exclusively.

> The finalized version from the `tpod.voidbreakdemo2` package to the `com.sulvic.voidbreak` package will take some time as there some additional content as well as finalized functional ideas being added on top of the rewrite.

## Introduction

For all those that dare to follow through and break reality beyond the extremes, you may just end up receiving some unforseen problems that may come your way.

What would occur when you survive beyond the world's end for the first time?

## Mod Information

### Normal Content

There a quite a few additional items for the normal part of the game.

Zombies have a 12% chance to drop either a sweet potato (75% chance) or a baked sweet potato (25% chance).

There are also two new biomes to discover, the flatlands (a nearly barren plains) and the citrus grove (the only way to get the citrus tree and some oranges).

### Getting under the world?

There may be some issues with some random holes in the bottom of the world after beating the main bosses. What could possibly be the reason behind this? Would you dare to find out?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may have some concerns about how this mod will alter already loaded chunks to remove blocks from a random X and Z position chosen by the world.
>
> Do not worry, all affected blocks will only ever be bedrock blocks. They will be stored as a part of the chunk data under as a list of their original coordinates and will have a config allows them to be placed back if you prefer.

## Mod Purpose

The main purpose is to have a massive amount of endgame content after both the Ender Dragon & and the Wither (also the Warden... maybe some other mod bosses as well... probably...) for you the player to discover and explore.
